      content="Tech Club of Government College of Engineering And Ceramic Technology is located at the heart of the campus of Govt College Of Engg. & Ceramic Technology (GCECT). Here in GCECT where people lead a busy life, the name 'Tech Club' itself brings a breeze of happiness, relaxation, pleasure and many joyous moments to the students who are in love with technology . It is truly a place for techno freaks to create or work on something new beyond their hectic schedules. As many of the GCECT community do not often get a chance to meet their relatives, Tech Club provides a unique opportunity to make them forget their homesickness by hosting various events throughout the year on various technologies and gaming sessions. It in essence gives a 'home away from home feeling' to the club members making a big joint family of techno freaks who came together to create something new in this ever developing modern world"
